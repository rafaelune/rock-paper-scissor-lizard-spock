Rock-Paper-Scissor-Lizard-Spock Dojo Challenge
==============================================

>Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock is an expansion of the classic selection method game rock-paper-scissors. It operates on the same basic principle, but includes two additional weapons: the lizard and Spock.

### RULES ###
Each player picks a hand-shape, then all players reveal their choices at the same time. The winner is the one who defeats the others. The rules of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock are:

- Scissors cut Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitate Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock
- Rock crushes Scissors

There are fifteen possible pairings of the five gestures. Each gesture beats two of the other gestures and is beaten by the remaining two. In a tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found. The original rules (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock) remain the same.
